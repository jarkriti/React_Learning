1) React is a JS library for building UI.

2) UI in react contains multiple reusable components. They are custom HTML code written in JS that is converted to HTML by react.

3) React is written in JS so it is fast as JS runs on browser itself.

4) Steps to create a react project:

    a) All the code gets rendered using ReactDOM. ReactDOM converts react code written in JSX to HTML DOM.

    ReactDOM.render(app, document.querySelector('#app'));

    Here in render function, first argument is the root component that needs to be rendered on HTML component.
    Second argument is the HTML component on which React component will be rendered.

    var app = (
        <div>
        <Person name='Kriti' age='26'></Person>
        <Person name='Manu' age='27'></Person>
        </div>
    )

    function Person(props){
        return (
            <div className='person'>
            <h1>{props.name}</h1>
            <p>Your age: {props.age}</p>
            </div>
        )
    }

    In react components, they must start from capital letter. In basic terms they are function with props as an argument that is passed
    to them. It must contain a return value that is the JSX that needs to returned.

    All the dynamic values are written within curly braces.
